# Kijiji Map View

As a frequent Kijiji user myself, one of the things that irks me is how cumbersome it is to find a great deal for something that I want to buy (playing cards, NHL jerseys, etc) located in my area (Toronto, Canada) only to find that I have to travel a great distance by transit in order to obtain the item. 

To solve this problem, I built a web app using Vue.js as the front-end and Node.js / kijiji-scraper npm package on the back-end to obtain the results of a Kijiji search, and display their locations using Google Maps. 

# NOW ACCESSIBLE ON THE WEB!
